## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data needs to be dynamically rendered as users interact with the app. React uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be composed to create complex UIs. It also utilizes a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, making it highly performant.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. In this project, CSS is used to style the application, including the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. By using CSS, the application maintains a consistent look and feel across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a better user experience.
- **HTML5**: HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard markup language used to structure content on the web. HTML5 introduces new elements, attributes, and behaviors that make it easier to create more interactive and efficient web pages. In this project, HTML5 is used to structure the application's content, providing the foundation for the React components and ensuring semantic and accessible content.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the core programming language used in this project. It is a versatile and powerful language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. JavaScript is used alongside React to handle the logic and behavior of the application, manage the state, and manipulate the DOM. Its integration with React allows for seamless updates and rendering of the user interface based on user interactions and data changes.
